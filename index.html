			<h2 class="sectionTitle">What is Boid Flocking?</h2>
			<p class="sectionText">
				Boid Flocking is an algorithm that was developed in 1986 by Craig
				Reynolds to simulate the flocking behavior of birds. The term "boid" is
				short for "bird-oid object".
			</p>
			<h2 class="sectionTitle">How does it work?</h2>
			<p class="sectionText">Each boid follows three rules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Cohesion - the boid will try to occupy the center of the boids within
					it's visual range
				</li>
				<li>
					Separation - the boid will try to avoid colliding with the boids
					around it
				</li>
				<li>
					Alignment - the boid will try and match it's velocity (speed and
					direction) to the boids within it's visual range
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="sectionText">
				The behavior of the flock can be modified by changing how much "force"
				is applied to the boids by each rule. For instance, if we were to lower
				the separation force, then the boids in the flock would fly closer
				together. If we were to turn the separation rule off completely, then
				the boids would not try to maintain distance from each other and would
				all overlap each other (you can try this by sliding the separation
				slider all the way to the left).
			</p>
			<h2 class="sectionTitle">How is this implemented in my code?</h2>
			<p class="sectionText">
				Source code for my boid flocking implementation can be found on my
				<a href="https://github.com/marcusL1019/boidFlocking">GitHub</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="sectionText">
				A boid class is defined in a separate script (boid.js) which contains
				methods that control the behavior of each boid. These methods include
				the three rules mentioned above, as well as methods which control the
				boid behavior when they approach the edge of the canvas, calculate
				distance between a boid and another boid, and limit the speed of each
				boid so they dont fly too fast.
			</p>
			<p class="sectionText">
				Another script (main.js) sets the size of the canvas, creates the boids
				and adds them to an array, and then runs the animation function which
				updates the positions of each boid and then schedules another animation
				frame which calls the animation function.
			</p>
			<p class="sectionText">
				psuedocode provided by the following
				<a href="http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html">resource [1]</a>
				was used to help implement the three rules, with some further guidance
				provided by the following
				<a href="https://eater.net/boids">boid flocking implementation [2]</a>.
